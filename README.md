# Problem_01_heatmap
This is an example of a heatmap application I found for Problem 1 on my STAT 651 Midterm.

The original app is the [Absolutely-Positioned Panels](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/absolutely-positioned-panels.html) Shiny application created by Joe Cheng. The original code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples/tree/main/027-absolutely-positioned-panels).

The files from the original application have been copied to ensure they can run locally. This copy can be found at the following link:
